## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data <- data.frame(values = rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10))

# Create a ggplot histogram
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data, aes(x = values)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Demo Histogram of Normally Distributed Data",
       x = "Values",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{python}
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a[0])
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
